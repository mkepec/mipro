I have now processed the proceedings for the years you have provided (2010-2012, 2023, 2024 and 2025). The papers are listed in markdown files in the `papers` directory, categorized by conference and year.

This should provide us with a good foundation for our research. We can now analyze the paper titles to identify trends, popular topics, and potential gaps that you could address.

I am now ready to move on to the next step: **brainstorming paper ideas**.

We can start by looking at the intersection of your expertise and the topics of the various MIPRO conferences, and now also considering the papers that have been published in the past.

Please let me know if you are ready to proceed with brainstorming.
