# Research Summary and Next Steps

## Summary of Work Done

*   **Repository Structure:** I have created a directory structure to organize the project:
    *   `background/`: Contains a summary of your professional background, skills, and experience.
    *   `conference-info/`: Contains detailed information about the MIPRO conference, including:
        *   A list of all conferences with their specific topics.
        *   Information about submission fees and deadlines.
        *   Instructions for authors.
    *   `papers/`: This directory is currently empty as I was unable to reliably retrieve a list of previous papers.
    *   `ideas/`: This directory is ready for brainstorming.

*   **Your Background:** I have analyzed your CV and LinkedIn profile and created a `background/README.md` file that summarizes your expertise.

*   **MIPRO Conference Information:** I have gathered a significant amount of information about the MIPRO conference and its sub-conferences. All this information is available in the `conference-info` directory.

## Challenges

I have encountered significant difficulties in obtaining a list of previous papers from the MIPRO conference. The official IEEE Xplore website uses dynamic content loading that prevents me from easily extracting the paper lists. Other sources I have tried have proven to be unreliable.

## Next Steps: Brainstorming Paper Ideas

Given the detailed information we have about your background and the conference topics, I suggest we move on to the next step: **brainstorming paper ideas**.

We can start by looking at the intersection of your expertise and the topics of the various MIPRO conferences. I can help you identify the most relevant conferences for your profile and we can then start generating some concrete paper ideas.

Please let me know if you are ready to proceed with brainstorming.
