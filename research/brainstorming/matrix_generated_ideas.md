# Brainstorming Matrix: A Broader List of Research Topics

This document provides a broad list of potential research topics generated by cross-referencing your core competencies with trending themes from the MIPRO conferences. The goal is to provide a wide set of starting points for a new research paper.

### Competency Area: DevOps & Automation (IaC, CI/CD)

*   **x Generative AI:** A framework for using LLMs to automatically generate IaC (Terraform/CloudFormation) configurations from high-level natural language descriptions.
*   **x Digital Twins:** A CI/CD pipeline that automatically updates a system's Digital Twin upon a successful production deployment, ensuring the twin remains synchronized with reality.
*   **x Green Computing/FinOps:** An automated system that integrates carbon footprint estimation and cost analysis directly into the pull request/code review process for infrastructure changes.
*   **x Serverless/Edge:** A comparative study of CI/CD patterns for deploying applications to edge devices versus traditional cloud serverless environments.
*   **x XAI:** Using Explainable AI to audit and explain the behavior of complex, automated deployment pipelines to meet compliance and security requirements.
*   **x Cybersecurity:** A DevSecOps approach to automating security policy enforcement within a CI/CD pipeline, including static analysis (SAST), dynamic analysis (DAST), and dependency scanning.

### Competency Area: Cloud Architecture (AWS/Azure)

*   **x Generative AI:** Evaluating the performance and cost-effectiveness of hosting and fine-tuning LLMs on different AWS vs. Azure GPU-enabled instance types.
*   **x Digital Twins:** Designing a multi-cloud architecture for a resilient Digital Twin that can fail over between AWS and Azure.
*   **x Green Computing/FinOps:** A multi-cloud FinOps strategy: How to use tools like Azure Cost Management and AWS Cost Explorer in a unified dashboard to manage spending across platforms.
*   **x Serverless/Edge:** A performance and cost benchmark of serverless container platforms: AWS Fargate vs. Azure Container Apps.
*   **x IoT:** Architecting a scalable and secure data ingestion pipeline for IoT devices using a combination of AWS IoT Core and Azure Event Hubs.
*   **x Cybersecurity:** A case study on implementing a "least privilege" IAM strategy in a complex, multi-account AWS organization.

### Competency Area: Observability (Logging, Monitoring, AIOps)

*   **x Generative AI:** An LLM-based chatbot that allows engineers to query observability platforms (e.g., Grafana, ADX) using natural language questions instead of complex query languages (e.g., "Show me the error rate for the checkout service in the last hour").
*   **x Digital Twins:** Using a Digital Twin to simulate failure scenarios and generate synthetic observability data to train and validate AIOps anomaly detection models.
*   **x Green Computing/FinOps:** Developing an "observability for sustainability" dashboard that correlates application performance metrics with the real-time carbon intensity of the underlying cloud region.
*   **x Serverless/Edge:** A framework for achieving end-to-end distributed tracing across a hybrid architecture of on-premise services, serverless functions, and edge devices.
*   **x XAI:** Applying XAI techniques to anomaly detection models in Prometheus to explain *why* a certain metric is considered anomalous, reducing alert fatigue for engineers.

### Competency Area: Containerization (Kubernetes, Docker)

*   **x Generative AI:** A tool that uses an LLM to generate Kubernetes manifest files (YAML) from a simple high-level description of the desired application state.
*   **x Digital Twins:** Using a Kubernetes cluster to host a microservices-based Digital Twin, analyzing the performance and scalability of this approach.
*   **x Green Computing/FinOps:** A study on the effectiveness of Kubernetes cluster autoscaling combined with spot instances as a strategy for reducing cloud costs and energy consumption.
*   **x Serverless/Edge:** A performance comparison of different Kubernetes distributions for edge computing (e.g., K3s vs. MicroK8s).
*   **x Cybersecurity:** A practical guide to hardening a Kubernetes cluster, covering topics from network policies and RBAC to pod security policies and container image scanning.

### Competency Area: Engineering Education

*   **x Generative AI:** Assessing the impact of using AI-powered code assistants (like GitHub Copilot) on novice programmers' learning outcomes and code quality in an introductory programming course.
*   **x Digital Twins:** Developing a simplified, web-based "Digital Twin" of a city's traffic system as an educational tool for teaching students about IoT, data analytics, and simulation.
*   **x Pedagogy/e-Learning:** A case study on using the AWS Learner Lab sandbox to implement project-based learning for a university-level cloud computing course.
*   **x Serverless/Edge:** Creating a curriculum module for teaching serverless concepts and FaaS, complete with hands-on labs deployable in the AWS Learner Lab.
*   **x Metaverse/VR:** Using VR/AR to create an immersive virtual data center tour to teach students about the physical hardware, networking, and security that underpins the cloud.
