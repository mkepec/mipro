## Recommended Examination Strategy

### Phase 1: Get Abstracts (Do First)
**Priority 1 - Must have abstracts** (Core to your ideas):
- Papers 1, 2, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 14, 15, 16, 21, 23

**Priority 2 - Good to have**:
- Papers 3, 12, 17, 18, 22, 24, 25

### Phase 2: Get Full Papers (After Abstract Review)
**Must read full papers** (These are closest to your ideas):
1. "Interactive Programming Tutorials in Automated Programming Assessment System Edgar" (2024)
2. "IT Education in Clouds and Clouds in IT Education" (2022)
3. "Introduction of the Automated Assessment..." (2014)
4. "Enhancing Programming Education with Open-Source Generative AI Chatbots" (2024) [Junior]
5. "GenAI in DevOps: Boon or a Bane" (2025)
6. "Container vs. Function as a Service..." (2024)

**Should read if relevant after abstract** (Pick 3-4):
7. "Cloud Based Laboratory for Distance Education" (2013)
8. "Exploring the Role of Large Language Models in Advancing Student Assessment..." (2025)
9. "Assessing the Efficiency of Java Virtual Threads..." (2024) [Junior]
10. "Using ChatGPT in Designing Web Applications..." (2025) [Junior]

### Phase 3: Analyze Structure
For each full paper, note:
1. **Page count**: Verify it's 6 pages
2. **Section structure**: Introduction, Related Work, Methodology, Results, Discussion, Conclusion
3. **Figure/table count**: How many visuals?
4. **Methodology details**: How much space for methods vs results?
5. **Related work**: How many references? How detailed?
6. **Results**: Quantitative data? Qualitative? Both?
7. **Scope**: Pilot study? Full deployment? Theoretical?
8. **Writing style**: Technical depth vs accessibility

## What to Look For

### For IaC Progressive Learning Paper
**From education papers (1, 2, 7, 8):**
- How do they structure lab environment descriptions?
- How much technical detail on infrastructure?
- How do they present comparative studies?
- What metrics do they use for "learning outcomes"?
- How do they handle IRB/ethical considerations?

### For MCP Assessment Paper
**From assessment papers (6, 7, 8):**
- How do they evaluate "quality" of feedback?
- How do they measure time savings?
- How much detail on the tool architecture?
- Do they include user surveys? What questions?
- How do they present automation vs human comparison?

### For Junior Papers
**From junior papers (14, 15, 16, 17, 18):**
- What's the scope of student projects? (weeks? months?)
- How complex are the implementations?
- How much evaluation/testing is expected?
- Do they include quantitative results or just descriptions?
- How much related work do they cite?
- What's the innovation level expected?

### For Technical Papers (SSE)
**From DevOps/container papers (10, 11, 12, 13):**
- How deep do they go technically?
- Production system or lab/test environment?
- How do they structure performance comparisons?
- How many benchmarks/metrics?
- Balance of architecture description vs results?

## Notes on AWS MCP Junior Paper

After examining junior papers, specifically look for:
- **Scope appropriateness**: Can AWS MCP server project fit in one semester?
- **Complexity level**: Is building MCP server too simple? Too complex?
- **Evaluation type**: Implementation + demo? Or implementation + performance testing?

**Potential AWS MCP Junior Paper Ideas** (refine after examining #14-18):

**Option A: "Building a Cloud Infrastructure Chatbot with AWS MCP Servers"**
- Students build CLI chatbot that uses AWS MCP
- Queries EC2, S3, Lambda via natural language
- Evaluation: Compare to AWS CLI (ease of use, learning curve)

**Option B: "Automated AWS Cost Reporter Using MCP Integration"**
- Students build tool that uses AWS MCP to analyze costs
- Generates reports, recommendations
- Evaluation: Accuracy, usefulness, time savings

**Option C: "Natural Language Infrastructure Queries: Comparing AWS CLI, CloudShell, and MCP"**
- Comparative study by students
- Same tasks via different interfaces
- Evaluation: Speed, errors, user preference

## How to Proceed

1. **Copy-paste abstracts** for Priority 1 papers (12 papers) into text files
2. **Create**: `/Users/mkepec/private/mipro/research/analysis/abstracts/` folder
3. **Files**: `paper_01_abstract.txt`, `paper_02_abstract.txt`, etc.
4. **Review together**: We analyze abstracts to decide which full papers to get
5. **Get full papers**: For 6-8 papers we identify as most relevant
6. **Deep analysis**: Structure breakdown for your writing

---

## Quick Start Commands

```bash
# Create folder for abstracts
mkdir -p /Users/mkepec/private/mipro/research/analysis/abstracts

# Template for abstract files
# paper_XX_title_year.txt
# Contents:
# Title: [Full Title]
# Authors: [Authors]
# Year: [Year]
# Conference: [Conference Track]
#
# Abstract:
# [Paste abstract here]
```

## Decision Points After Abstract Review

**Question 1**: Are MIPRO education papers detailed enough for IaC implementation?
- If YES: Proceed with full IaC paper
- If NO: Consider simplifying scope or different venue

**Question 2**: Do assessment papers show AI/automation acceptance?
- If YES: MCP assessment is timely
- If NO: Frame as "pilot study" not "solution"

**Question 3**: What's the complexity level of junior papers?
- If HIGH: AWS MCP server is appropriate
- If MEDIUM: Need simpler AWS MCP application
- If LOW: AWS MCP might be too advanced

**Question 4**: How much evaluation is expected?
- Quantitative metrics required?
- User studies common?
- Can we do pilot study (10-20 students) or need full study (100+ students)?
