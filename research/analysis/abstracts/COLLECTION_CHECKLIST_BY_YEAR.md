## Efficient Collection Workflow

### Step 1: Collect All Abstracts First
For each year:
1. Open that year's PDF
2. Find each paper by title and author
3. Copy the abstract
4. Paste into corresponding template file
5. Close PDF, move to next year

### Step 2: Review Abstracts Together
After all 12 abstracts collected:
- I'll review them with you
- We'll identify patterns
- We'll decide which papers need full text

### Step 3: Collect Full Papers (Second Pass)
Based on abstract review, likely need full text for ~6-8 papers:
- **Definitely need full text**:
  - Paper 08 (LLM Student Assessment 2025) - Most relevant to MCP
  - Paper 06 (Programming Assessment 2024) - Assessment methodology
  - Paper 10 (GenAI in DevOps 2025) - AI + technical systems
  - Paper 14 (GenAI Chatbots Junior 2024) - Junior paper scope

- **Probably need full text**:
  - Paper 01 (IT Education in Clouds 2022) - Education methodology
  - Paper 02 (Cloud Laboratory 2013) - Lab infrastructure
  - Paper 15 (Java Threads Junior 2024) - Junior paper structure
  - Paper 16 (ChatGPT SQL Junior 2025) - Junior AI application

- **Maybe need full text** (decide after abstracts):
  - Paper 07, 11, 21, 23

## After Abstract Collection

**I will tell you which papers to paste in full after examining abstracts.**

Expected breakdown:
- **6-8 papers**: Full text needed (detailed analysis)
- **4-6 papers**: Abstract sufficient (context only)

**Why not all full papers?**
- Some papers may not be relevant after reading abstract
- Some papers may only need abstract for context
- Focus deep reading on most relevant papers
- Saves time and keeps analysis focused

## Tips for Finding Papers in PDFs

### By Conference Track
Papers are usually grouped by conference:
- **CE** (Computers in Education) - Usually large section
- **SSE** (Software and Systems Engineering) - Mid-size section
- **AIS** (Artificial Intelligence Systems) - Mid-size section
- **MIPRO Junior** - Separate section at end or beginning

### By Author Name
If PDF is searchable:
- Ctrl+F (Cmd+F on Mac)
- Search for first author's last name
- Usually faster than scrolling

### By Paper Title Keywords
Search for distinctive words from title:
- "Automated Assessment"
- "Cloud Based Laboratory"
- "GenAI in DevOps"
- "Virtual Threads"
