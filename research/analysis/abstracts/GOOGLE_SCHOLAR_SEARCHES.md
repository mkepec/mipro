**Non-MIPRO Papers**:
- ✓ State-of-the-art methodologies
- ✓ Broader range of approaches
- ✓ More comprehensive coverage
- ✓ Higher citation papers
- ✗ May be longer (8-12 pages)
- ✗ Different conference expectations

**Strategy**: Use both
- **MIPRO papers**: For structure and scope
- **Non-MIPRO papers**: For methodology and state-of-art
- **Cite both**: Shows comprehensive literature review
