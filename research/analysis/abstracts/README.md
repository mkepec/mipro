## Collection Strategy

### Phase 1: Get ALL Abstracts (This Week)
- [ ] Papers 1, 2 (Cloud education)
- [ ] Papers 6, 7, 8 (Assessment)
- [ ] Papers 10, 11 (DevOps/Containers)
- [ ] Papers 14, 15, 16 (Junior examples)
- [ ] Papers 21, 23 (LLM applications)

### Phase 2: Review Abstracts Together
After all abstracts collected:
1. Review each for relevance
2. Identify patterns in structure/scope
3. Select 6-8 papers for full text

### Phase 3: Get Full Papers
Priority for full papers (after abstract review):
- **Must have**: Papers 6, 8, 10, 14 (most relevant)
- **Should have**: Papers 1, 2, 7, 11 (methodology examples)
- **Nice to have**: Papers 15, 16, 21, 23 (additional context)

## Where to Find Papers

### IEEE Xplore
- URL: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/
- Search: "MIPRO" + paper title
- Filter by year

### MIPRO Proceedings (Direct)
- URL: https://www.mipro.hr/
- Navigate to specific year proceedings
- Browse by conference track (CE, SSE, etc.)

### Tips
- Papers from 2013-2020 may be harder to find online
- Recent papers (2024-2025) should be on IEEE Xplore
- Junior papers may be in separate section of proceedings

## Questions to Answer After Abstract Review

**For IaC Progressive Learning:**
1. How much technical infrastructure detail do education papers include?
2. Do they do comparative studies or just implementations?
3. What metrics do they use for "learning outcomes"?
4. How large are their student samples?

**For MCP Assessment:**
1. How do existing papers evaluate "quality" of automated feedback?
2. What's the balance between tool description vs evaluation?
3. Do they include user surveys? What questions?
4. How do they handle AI/automation concerns?

**For Junior Papers:**
1. What's typical scope? (weeks/months of work?)
2. How much evaluation/testing is expected?
3. What's the complexity level?
4. Do they need quantitative results or qualitative OK?

**For AWS MCP Junior Idea:**
1. Is building an MCP server appropriate complexity?
2. Should it be implementation-focused or comparison-focused?
3. What would be the evaluation criteria?

## Next Steps After Templates

1. **Collect abstracts** (paste into templates)
2. **Initial review** (mark relevance notes)
3. **Discuss findings** (identify patterns)
4. **Get full papers** (6-8 most relevant)
5. **Deep structure analysis** (create outline template)
6. **Scope decisions** (finalize what to write)
