Abstract – The rapid development of information and
communication technology (ICT) and growing participation
of students in work life has already in several decades
moved ICT education into 'clouds', using sources of
knowledge on Internet from all around the world. The
COVID pandemic has increased this process, forcing
universities to restrict classroom teaching and rapidly
increased student's self-study.
At the same time, increase of amounts of data to be
processed is constantly introducing new high-level software
technologies, layers and layers of packages and libraries,
deeper and more complex. This has created a new 'top-
down' programming style: a new project is started with
importing mass of libraries which have been used in earlier
projects and only then is considered how to use them in
order to solve the programming task. The self-studying ICT
students see only tips of modern software icebergs and it is
difficult for them to understand their working without face-
to-face classroom communication where details of the
'depths' are explained.

I. INTRODUCTION.
Humanity is obsessed with growth, but we have
already for years overusing possibilities for quantitative
growth [ 1 ],[ 2 ], thus we have intensively develop
qualitative means for growth [ 3 ],[ 4 ]. According to
UNESCO Science report 2021 [ 5 ], global research
spending grows faster than other sectors of the World
Economy. There are already 8.8 million scientists
worldwide and the number is growing. Thus global
research production of science and engineering
publications is also rapidly growing, e.g. in USA the
annual growth has been 4% during the last 10 years [6].
Scientific research together with statistical data
collected from various fields of human activities are
creating a world-wide overflow of data [7].
Figure 2. Growth of accepted publication to the Mipro conference
coverence (by the size of proceedings [9]) and the linear
model of the process
Most of this overflow of data is open and stored in
various open-source repositories. The continuous growth
of new knowledge is also reflected in education. Trying to
comply with rising demand for remote learning makes
colleges and universities to move cloud-based platforms
[10]. Education is increasingly becoming virtual [11].

II. COMPUTING IN CLOUDS
The modern world-wide data processing infrastructure
(computer + mobile networks, sometimes referred as
MCC - Mobile Cloud Computing [ 12 ]) covers all
continents and countries and is rapidly growing.
According to recent forecast [ 13 ] the global cloud
computing market size is expected to reach USD 1,251.09
billion by 2028, that the annual growth over the period
being 19.1%. The growth of cloud computing in education
is expected even bigger – 25.6% [14]. In 2021 nearly half
(42%) of enterprises in EU used cloud computing [15].
Figure 3. Percentage of enterprizes which used cloud in 2021 [16].
The worldwide cloud is besides quantitatively
developing also qualitatively. Cloud is a service – you do
not own anything, you pay for use. Besides the big cloud
services (Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, Amazon AWS)
have appeared several new ones - Heroku, GearHost,
Gamatera, Red Hat OpenShift, Oracle Cloud, Fly.io,
Classroom.cloud etc, [17], which offer various prize plans
and services; conditions vary depending on your country.
The first service in cloud was just provide connection.
But soon appeared also applications (SaaS – Sofware as a
Service, IaaS – Infrastructure as a Service), e.g. e-mail and
messaging and then Microsoft presented all of Microsoft
Office programs as an on-line service and many cloud
providers followed. The next step was PaaS – Platform as
a Service – a set of interconnected programs for some
activity – database, text translation, text-to-speech/speech-
to-text, chatbots, Machine Learning (ML) etc. For
instance, the Microsoft Azure [ 18 ] proposes several
services, programs and programming platforms: Bing,
WindowsLive, OfficeLive, SQL, Microsoft Advertising,
SharePoint, .Net etc, but in PaaS client is not driving, he
can only select from presented by the platform
opportunities.
For education in the clouds the quickest annual growth
until 2027 is expected just for the PaaS sector – 22.4%
[19] – education is expected to become more-and more a
service like McDonald's – you just select from a menu
available options – amount of fries and/or ketchup.
Cloud-based platforms for learning offer many
features which give them edge over traditional education
methodologies, first of all their integration with
smartphones and other internet-connected devices which
can facilitate learning from any location. A bit over-
emphasized seems in some of them functionality for the
social interaction what makes several of them to look like
'Facebooks for Education'.
There are also strictly technical platforms; which
usually are intended for business, but can also be used for
education. For instance, the PlayFab [20] (sub-platform of
the Microsoft Azure) is designed for creating commercial
online games (also for multiplayer games). The platform
has functions for creating new players (following strict
security rules) and collecting results of games -
scoreboards. The features of scoreboards (e.g. ordering by
results) allow to use them for managing student's results in
tests/exams, thus in Tallinn University of Technology was
tested a test system, where teacher(s) could upload from a
browser a test (as a multiplayer game) and get sorted
results as PlayFab scoreboards. Uploading a test and
getting results happens from a www-browser and can be
done anywhere - no Moodle managers needed. For this
experimental system tests were created with the free Half-
Backed Potatoes system [21 ], but a student created a
similar system for Google's Firebase [22] describing tests
with a spreadsheet (as a Kahoot [23] game). Both these
systems allowed multiplayer (i.e. parallel) tests, where all
participants started and ended the test at the same time, i.e.
everyone was competing with everyone in a limited time.
Game/test ended when some player announced 'Ready!' or
when pre-set time (e.g. 5 min) run out, thus exluding a
situation (common in traditional exams) when student is
pleading "No, I'm not yet ready, I need some more time!"
– but in the last five minutes has not added anything to his
test paper. In our competition-based society timeliness is
also an ability what we should teach to our students.
III. GROWING COMPLEXITY OF COMPUTING
A. 'Top-down' computing
In order to be useful from data should be extracted the
'essence' – knowledge. Tremendous growth of data has
created research directions aimed at extracting new
knowledge from data: Data Science (DS), Machine
Learning (ML), Artificial Intelligence (AI). For handling
massive amounts of data in clusters, grids and virtual
networks have been developed many new, higher-level
techniques and tools – new programming languages (R,
Go, Julia, Swift etc), pre-compiled (for speed) modules
(useful functions that eliminate the need for writing your
own code), libraries (collections of modules) and
frameworks (which already govern the whole process of
creating a new software product).
The 'Lingua Franca', the common of all areas of Data
Science is Python [ 24 ] (sometimes called 'everyone's
second language' - Python has been among the 10 most
popular programming languages every year since 2004
[25], in February 2022 Python was on the top, growing
15.33%). Its 'rising above others' has several reasons (e.g.
from 'Zen of Python" [26]: 'Beautiful is better than ugly',
'Simple is better than complex', 'Readability counts' etc.),
but one of the main reasons have been libraries – you do
not have to 'invent a bicycle' –somebody has already done
this and stored the code as a (open-source) library.
MIPRO 2022/CE 685
Currently are in the Python Package Index [27] (open-
source repository for Python code) stored over 5.6 million
files.
The number of libraries is rapidly growing also for other
languages, e.g. during the first week of February 2022,
Feb 1st - Feb 7th were every day for the node.js [28]
platform uploaded in average 819 modules [29].
Figure 4. Number of uploaded new node.js modules during
Feb.1st..Feb.7th, 2022 [29]
B. A Light-weight Example
Use of pre-built modules and libraries make creation of
new pieces of software fabulously easy. For instance, the
graph in Fig.2 was created with few lines of Python 3
code (the lines starting with # are commentaries for
humans; for ease of referencing lines are numbered – the
numbers are not part of the code) and two Python 3
libraries: numpy (numeric Python) and matplotlib
(library for plotting mathematical functions; for
convenience are packages given shorter names):
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
# x-axis values
x = range(2012,2022) # integers from
2012 to 2021
# corresponding y-axis values
y =
[166,124,172,183,87,131,155,214,131,269]
# plotting the graph
plt.plot(x, y)
# naming the axes
plt.xlabel('year')
plt.ylabel('size in KB')
# giving a title to the graph
plt.title('MIPRO proceedings 2012 -
2021')
# computing coefficients for the linear
model, m = slope, b=intercept
m, b = np.polyfit(x, y, 1)
#draw the line
plt.plot(x, m*x + b)
# show the plot
plt.show()
Nowadays this text should be understandable also to
non-programmers.
C. What happens under the hood
But programmers studying the above code will wonder
– no loops ??? The 'classical' program, i.e. using only
commands from a programming language without any
libraries would have to use several loops, e.g. projecting
values to axes. Calculating approximation (regression)
model involves (in theory) differentiating the minimal
squares model and then solving the system of linear
equations – here the regression parameters m,b appear in
one line. The AI (Artificial Intelligence) – calculating the
size and visually pleasing placement of axes - is totally
hidden.
The main task of Data Science is reducing the size of
data, extracting knowledge by creating models. In the
above code a single line produces coefficients m,b of the
linear regression function. For making prediction for
future years this line replaces need to know ten y-values
with only two numbers. It is easy to create a more
complex models, e.g. the second-order model in Fig.1 is
obtained modifying only two lines in the above program:
n,m,b = np.polyfit(x,y,2)
plt.plot(x,n*x*x+m*x+b)
All the functionality of the above program is hidden in
the two explicitly called libraries numpy, matplotlib
and many others called by these two. The pyinstaller
[ 30 ] tool reveals, that for drawing of this graph are
imported altogether 162 modules (and 28 items still
appeared as MissingModule):
bootlocale • _collections_abc • _weakrefset …
types • warnings • weakref
The added modules increased the size (on disk) of the
program 31882 times – from 2 KB to 63764 KB. It is
impossible to know what all these 162 modules actually
do and why they are needed.
Such 'blow-up' is a common feature of modern
software. The developed by Facebook JavaScript library
React.js advertises that "React makes it painless to
create interactive User Interfaces" [31]. The very first
example, a web page with text "Hello World" [32] loads
for creating this functionality three JavaScript libraries
with 73571+3358+26275 = 103204 lines of JavaScript
code (but the resulting page can be created without any
JavaScript). For a student this is not "painless", but (very)
painful. React.js was created by Facebook (now Meta)
programmers to create and handle many www-pages with
different structure (task for 72000 programmers in 2022
[33]). But something with 103204 lines of code is not a
tutorial for students, they start with a one page.
But 40.14% of web developers use React.js [34].
The main burden – 73571 lines of code (after un-
minifying) comes from the Babel library for interpreting
Ecmascript ES6 (the official name for JavaScript). All
major browsers can handle ES6 already for last five years
[35], thus Babel is not needed [36], it only increases
page's size and slows it down, but with 'copy-paste'
programming style it is difficult to understand that
something is obsolete ('All previous examples used that!').
Software technology is constantly and rapidly
developing and changing, thus software packages also
686 MIPRO 2022/CE
grow old, become obsolete or their APIs change. Use of
outdated libraries makes difficult (sometimes impossible)
to perform the necessary modifications, software
maintenance becomes time-consuming, labor intensive
and error-prone. When the jQuery library appeared back
in 2006 it was needed to reduce developer's problems with
the Microsoft's Internet Explorer 6 browser, which did not
follow standards and was dangerous to use (the IE 6 has
been included in the list of the 25 Worst Tech Products of
all time [37]). The jQuery parses the HTML document,
but all modern browsers can do this and do not need any
help, thus currently its main function has become obsolete
[38] [39] [40], it just duplicates browser's functionality.
Use of jQuery introduces several excessive operations
(request to download jQuery, downloading jQuery,
passing link of page's text to jQuery, processing in
jQuery, passing results back to browser), thus slows
down the page speed by 30-50% [41]. But 'developers',
whose main technology is 'copy-paste' from some existing
website often do not even understand, why they are
copying something, thus the jQuery is still used in 78%
of the top first million websites [38].
D. Problems for IT Students
The current pandemic has greatly increased student's
self-study. Already in 2017 the major text-books publisher
McGraw Hill found that 94% of students say that digital
learning helps them to retain new material [42]. Internet
contains many high-level sources of IT knowledge. But it
contains also many 'fake news', libraries, created with the
only desire of creator to advertise himself, some directly
dangerous downloads [43] [44] or deliberately corrupted
libraries [45].
Modern software is like icebergs in Antarctica – the
main part is hidden. Self-studying students see only the
top. It is quite difficult for students to 'dig deep',
understand the hidden functionality, understand cryptic
error messages which come from somewhere (what means
"can't multiply sequence by non-int of type
'numpy.float64'" ?) and cannot assess the real value of
proposed on Internet novelties, which are advertised with
meaningless statements "It just works". A student claimed
(when presenting his diploma project) that he does not use
css-stylesheets – he uses Bulma [46], which advertises
itself as "the modern CSS framework that just works. No
CSS knowledge required". Student was a quite proper
target to use something what does not require knowledge
– his css-file contained 15301 css-rules for application
having less than 100 html-elements to use these rules.
Student had got this css-monstrum by copy-paste and did
not know anything about its content – 182 rules were
addressing object 'hero', what his application did not have.
For comparison – css-file of one of the world's biggest
newspapers 'The new York Times" weekend edition has
455 css-rules for tens of thousands of html-elements.
The enormous hidden depth is present in all modern
software. Tree lines of code for neural net model in a
Python 3 program creates a model with nearly 4 million
parameters (output from the Python command
model.summary()):
vocab_size: 18
(64, 100, 18) # (batch_size,
sequence_length, vocab_size)
Model: "sequential"

With these nearly 4 million parameters the neural net
inferred from the texts of presentations from the Mipro
"Computers in Education" sub-conference that in Croatia
teachers are teaching computers and here are used quite
complex computers (a brief excerpt from the program's
output to seed "students") [47]:
Computers teachers and the actor model is that every
course controls, the comparison of the most popular
programming courses could be included in the class and
all of them with some topics of the course teachers in the
process of developing and procedures and other reasons
for the analyzing the control group (communication
sciences in the classroom. Computers in Croatia are
complex and addressed by the authors of the students
themselves in the process of learning and education to the
students who have to do by developing student their
results.
In another test with the same input – a text corpus created
from "Computers in Education" presentations computer
stated bluntly:
Students are not included in the process of e- learning in
the context of the process of teaching and learning.
Such results make many features of modern computers to
seem as non-deterministic, random [48]. For instance, if
somebody wants to get a high-order model for data about
Mipro presentations (Fig.2) using a neural net, then most
probably the result will look like this:
Figure 5. Possible results when trying to model data about Mipro
presentations with Tensorflow – there are too few points
MIPRO 2022/CE 687
Use of modules, libraries and platforms is inevitable in
modern software production, they enhance modularity and
essentially reduce development time. But their 'copy-
paste' use encompasses for students many problems.
Many IT students work as professional programmers
already on their first-second year of studies. Tasks what
commercial firms present to them are in several orders
more complex than the above graph-plotting program and
for creating a solution they are instructed to start with
importing tens of libraries. Thus they practice and learn
'top-down' programming – starting with the upper-level
general structure of their programming project, importing
popular libraries (whose functionality they do not totally
understand) and hoping, that these libraries miraculously
solve all the bottom-level problems. For example, a
student could program a test (as a multiplayer www and
mobile game) in the Google-s www and mobile
framework Firebase [22]. Program presented to users
multiple-select questions and assessed their answers, but
repeated questions – often for the next question appeared
the same what user just got and author was not able to
correct this (trivial) problem – he could not find such
functionality from Firebase functions, thus could not
eliminate repetitions.
IV. CONCLUSIONS
The world-wide pandemic has (and still is) essentially
disrupted education. According to UNESCO "More than
1.5 billion students and youth across the planet are or
have been affected by school and university closures due
to the COVID-19 pandemic."[ 49 ] This has greatly
increased student's self-studies from Internet resources.
This 'moving online' is forcing the currently most
faster-developing subarea of IT – the Data Science [50],
[51]. While it is possibly not the most asked skill in US
[52], it is still one of the most sought ability worldwide
and demand is much greater than supply [53].
Self-learning IT students do not see the general
picture, the hidden under multiple layers of libraries body
of software icebergs, they do not understand contexts and
connections and often do not apply their own judgment –
"Everybody does so!" or "This simply works!". Thus in
classroom one of the most important ones is 'moving back
to roots' explaining students the reasons why some IT
technology, protocol or library is just like it is and how it
become such. The Internet is a marvelous source of many
superb materials for self-study of IT technologies, but
most of WWW-tutorials are totally functional recipes:
import these libraries, then write those lines of code – with
minimal explanations, why just these libraries and just
those lines of code or using the totally meaningless
explanation "It Just Works!" The university classroom
should provide all missing explanations and reasons.
