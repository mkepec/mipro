## How to Find Papers in PDFs

### For Regular Conference Papers:
Papers are organized by conference track (CE, SSE, AIS, etc.)
- Use Ctrl+F / Cmd+F to search for author last name
- Or search for distinctive words from title

### For Junior Papers:
Junior papers are in separate section:
- Usually labeled "MIPRO Junior" or "Student Papers" or "SP"
- May be at beginning or end of proceedings
- Search for "Junior" to find the section start

### Tips:
- Junior papers from same authors often appear together
- Notice: Beronić/Mihaljević/Radovan have multiple junior papers
- Junior papers are usually shorter (4-6 pages)
- Check both student names and advisor names

## Pasting Instructions

### For Abstracts:
1. Find the paper in PDF
2. Copy the abstract (usually after author names, before Introduction)
3. Paste in template where it says `[PASTE ABSTRACT HERE]`
4. Add notes about relevance if needed

### For Full Papers:
1. Copy entire paper text (Introduction through References)
2. Paste in template where it says `[PASTE FULL PAPER BELOW]`
3. Include figures/tables if text describes them
4. OK if formatting is messy - we need content

## What Happens Next

After you collect these papers:
1. I'll analyze the structure of all 6 full papers (Papers 02, 07, D, E, F, G)
2. Create comparison table showing structure patterns
3. Identify what's expected for each paper type
4. Create template/outline for your papers
5. You'll be ready to start writing!

## Questions While Collecting?

If you encounter issues:
- **Can't find paper**: Try searching author name or keyword from title
- **Junior section not clear**: Search for "Student Papers" or "SP" in PDF
- **Wrong paper found**: Double-check author names match
- **PDF not searchable**: May need OCR, or browse through sections manually

---

## Notes

- Don't worry about perfect formatting when pasting
- Include as much text as possible for full papers
- References section is useful - shows what they cite
- Figures/diagrams are important but text is priority
- Save files frequently!

Good luck with collection! Let me know when you're done and I'll analyze the structure.
