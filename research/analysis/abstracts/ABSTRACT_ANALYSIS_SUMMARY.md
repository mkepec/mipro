## What We Learned from Abstracts

### About IaC for Progressive Learning

**Good news:**
- Paper 02 (2013) shows "Lab as a Service" was done before
- Concept of dynamic, elastic labs is established
- Your IaC idea is an EVOLUTION, not completely novel

**What to emphasize in your paper:**
- **Progressive** nature (week-by-week prerequisites)
- **Skill-based assessment** (intentionally broken infrastructure)
- **Modern tools** (Terraform/CloudFormation vs older cloud frameworks)
- **AWS Academy** specific context

### About MCP for Assessment

**Good news:**
- Paper 08 (2025) shows LLM assessment is CURRENT topic
- Paper 06 (2024) shows automated assessment systems with feedback are accepted
- Paper 07 (2014) shows comparative studies (manual vs automated) are valued

**What to emphasize in your paper:**
- MCP as **standardized** integration (vs custom systems)
- **Dual mode** (teacher + student) - unique approach
- **Course-specific context** via MCP (not generic ChatGPT)
- Address **limitations** explicitly (Paper 08 does this)

### About Junior Papers

**Excellent news from Paper 14:**
- Junior papers CAN be quite technical
- Step-by-step implementation guides are acceptable
- Including evaluation (model comparison) is expected
- RAG and fine-tuning topics are appropriate

**Scope for AWS MCP Junior paper:**
- Building an MCP server is APPROPRIATE complexity
- Should include: selection, implementation, evaluation
- Comparative aspect (AWS CLI vs MCP interface) would be good
- Need results/evaluation, not just implementation

### About DevOps + AI Papers

**From Paper 10 (2025):**
- "Algorithmic aversion" is REAL - people hesitant to trust AI
- Mixed feelings: productivity gains vs complexity
- Important to address **skepticism** in your papers

**For your MCP papers:**
- Acknowledge limitations upfront
- Emphasize human-in-the-loop
- Address hallucination concerns
- Show when AI helps vs when human needed
