*   Issues in the design and development of emerging HCI devices
*   Novel forms of authentication and authorization (e.g., raw HCI data)
*   Using HCI information and sensors to detect user states (e.g., emotion, cognitive conflict) and create more intelligent designs
*   Influence of HCI devices on attitudes, emotion, perception, and behavior
*   Applying HCI to overcome challenges related to IS use (e.g., technostress)
